# Notes

## Key concepts in federated schemas

- _Entities:_ These are types that can be referenced and extended by another service; in other words, they are the connection points of our federated graph.

- _Keys:_ We declare an entity by adding the @key directive to a type definition.

- _External type extensions:_ We can extend a type defined in a different service and add new fields to it using the extend type syntax. We can then use a combination of the @key and @external directives to connect the original type and the type extension.

- _Extending Query and Mutation types:_ We also use the extend type syntax to define the Query and Mutation root queries in each service, and we donâ€™t need to define their base types in any schema because Apollo will handle this at the gateway level.
